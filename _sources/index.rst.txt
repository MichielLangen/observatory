Welcome to the observatory
=======================================
Welcome to the observatory, a solution for tracking your machine learning models.

When working a machine learning model you will find yourself changing hyper parameters,
code, settings and data all the time. You may even end up choosing a different model alltogether.

Because of the high number of changes it is quite hard to keep track of what you have tried before.
Questions like:

 - Which model is the best for us?
 - How long did it take to train this model last time?
 - Which hyper parameters did I use?

 Are quite hard to answer if you're not careful.

 Observatory is a simple solution that allows you to keep track of outputs,
 metrics and configuration settings of your models.
