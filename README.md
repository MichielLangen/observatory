# Observatory
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wmeints/observatory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wmeints/observatory)

Welcome to the observatory, a solution for tracking your machine learning models.

When working a machine learning model you will find yourself changing hyper parameters, 
code, settings and data all the time. You may even end up choosing a different model alltogether.

Because of the high number of changes it is quite hard to keep track of what you have tried before.
Questions like:

 - Which model is the best for us?
 - How long did it take to train this model last time?
 - Which hyper parameters did I use?
 
Are quite hard to answer if you're not careful. 
 
Observatory is a simple solution that allows you to keep track of outputs, 
metrics and configuration settings of your models.

## Getting started
Please read [the documentation](https://wmeints.github.io/observatory/index.html) on the website to get started. 

## Development
Feel free to fork this repository and send me pull requests.
I personally recommend using PyCharm and/or Visual Studio Code for writing code.

To get started developing changes for this project, follow these steps:

 * `git clone https://github.com/wmeints/observatory`
 * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
Enjoy!
